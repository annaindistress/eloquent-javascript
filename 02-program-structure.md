# Program Structure

## Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to `console.log` to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

### Solution

```js
for (let str = '#'; str.length <= 7; str += '#') {
  console.log(str);
}
```

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses `console.log` to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

### Solution

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let result = '';
  if (i % 3 === 0) result += 'Fizz';
  if (i % 5 === 0) result += 'Buzz';
  console.log(result || i);
}
```

## Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a `#` character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to `console.log` should show something like this:

```
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
```

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding `size = 8` and change the program so that it works for any `size`, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

### Solution

```js
let size = 8;
let result = '';

for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < size; j++) {
    if ((i + j) % 2 === 0) {
      result += ' ';
    } else {
      result += '#';
    }
  }
  result += '\n';
}

console.log(result);
```
